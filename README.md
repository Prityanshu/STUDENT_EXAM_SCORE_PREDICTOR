   ```

6. **Open your browser** and navigate to `http://localhost:8501`

## 📊 Dataset

The application uses a comprehensive dataset with 50,000 student records containing:

- **Hours_Studied**: Daily study hours (0-12 hours)
- **Previous_Score**: Previous academic performance (0-100)
- **Attendance**: Class attendance percentage (50-100%)
- **Exam_Score**: Target variable - Final exam score (0-100)

## 🤖 Machine Learning Models

The system evaluates and compares multiple regression algorithms:

| Model | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **Random Forest** | Ensemble method using multiple decision trees |
| **Gradient Boosting** | Sequential ensemble with boosting |
| **Support Vector Regressor** | SVM for regression tasks |
| **Linear Regression** | Basic linear relationship modeling |
| **Ridge Regression** | Linear regression with L2 regularization |
| **Lasso Regression** | Linear regression with L1 regularization |
| **Decision Tree** | Single tree-based model |
| **K-Nearest Neighbors** | Instance-based learning |
| **AdaBoost** | Adaptive boosting ensemble |
| **Extra Trees** | Extremely randomized trees |

### Model Selection Criteria

- **R² Score**: Primary metric for model selection (coefficient of determination)
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**: Average squared prediction errors
- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**: Average absolute prediction errors
- **Cross-Validation**: 5-fold CV for robust performance estimation

## 🔧 Usage Examples

### Making Predictions

```python
# Example: Predict score for a student
Hours_Studied = 7.5
Previous_Score = 82.0
Attendance = 88.0

# The app will predict the exam score and provide insights
```

### Interpreting Results

- **90+ Score**: Excellent performance expected 🎉
- **80-89 Score**: Good performance expected 👍
- **70-79 Score**: Average performance expected 📚
- **60-69 Score**: Below average - additional support needed ⚠️
- **<60 Score**: Poor performance - immediate intervention required 🚨

## 📈 Model Performance

The application automatically selects the best-performing model based on validation metrics. Typical performance:

- **R² Score**: 0.85-0.95 (explains 85-95% of variance)
- **Mean Absolute Error**: 3-5 points
- **Root Mean Squared Error**: 4-7 points

## 🆘 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Models not found error**
   ```bash
   # Solution: Run the training script first
   python train_model.py
   ```

2. **Missing dependencies**
   ```bash
   # Solution: Install all requirements
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Data file not found**
   ```bash
   # Ensure student_performance_50000.csv is in the project directory
   ```

### Performance Issues

- For large datasets, model training may take several minutes
- PDF generation with many visualizations can be memory-intensive
- Consider reducing dataset size for faster prototyping

## 📊 Sample Results

```
Best Model: Random Forest Regressor
R² Score: 0.9234
Mean Squared Error: 12.45
Mean Absolute Error: 2.87
Cross-Validation R² Mean: 0.9187
```
